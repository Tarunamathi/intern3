Place PDF files related to the Food & Nutrition section in this folder.

Recommended filename format: `food-nutrition-<short-name>.pdf` (e.g. `food-nutrition-guidelines-2025.pdf`).

Access example from the app: `/docs/food-nutrition/food-nutrition-guidelines-2025.pdf`

How to reference in Next.js/React:

- Static link: `<a href="/docs/food-nutrition/food-nutrition-guidelines-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a>`

I can also add a simple listing page to show these files—tell me if you want that.
