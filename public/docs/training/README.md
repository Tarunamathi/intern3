Place PDF files related to Training in this folder.

Recommended filename format: `training-<short-name>.pdf` (e.g. `training-syllabus-2025.pdf`).

Access example from the app: `/docs/training/training-syllabus-2025.pdf`

How to reference in Next.js/React:

- Static link: `<a href="/docs/training/training-syllabus-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a>`

If you'd like, I can add a small downloads page at `/training` that shows these files.
